$ rm .git/index.lock
$ git add docs
$ git commit -m "add docs folder"
$ git push

========================================
the index.lock command came from
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38004148/another-git-process-seems-to-be-running-in-this-repository/38004454
=======================================
also see suggestions at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43690977/commit-a-large-number-of-files-in-rstudio-using-git-panel
--------

Of course you can ignore the GUI and stick to the command-line Git forever, but if you don't want, a quick jump to the command-line git would solve this problem for now.

The temporary solution that I found is as follows:

Click on the blue-gear icon on the GIT panel, inside RStudio.
Select Shell (a terminal window will pup up!)
Write the add and commit command in the terminal:
{ATTENTION: The following command will commit changes on ALL files! You may want to use what is appropriate for your situation!}

    git add -A && git commit -m 'staging all files'
Now you can go back to the GUI Git, and click on push button. All files that you staged in the terminal window, will be pushed up to your repository.
----------
========================================
made edits to Github repo
set up github pages to master/docs folder
need to know the url for these pages - put as baseurl below

in config.toml
publishDir = "docs"
baseurl = "https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/blogdownAcademic/"
=====================================
also RStudio git seems to hang with the large # of files
in the /docs directory
so use git command line
====================================
$ rm .git/index.lock
$ git add docs
$ git commit -m "update docs folder"
$ git push
=================================
Now it works at https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/blogdownAcademic/
